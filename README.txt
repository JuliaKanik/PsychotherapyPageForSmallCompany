## Project Description

PsychotherapyPageForSmallCompany is a web application designed for small therapy practices. It currently serves as a platform to showcase therapy services and provide a convenient form for inquiries. Our goal is to create a user-friendly and informative online presence for potential clients.

## Current Development Status

At present, this project is primarily focused on the frontend display of therapy offers and the contact form. We are actively working on expanding its functionality by creating a backend system. This backend will enable the practice owner or designated staff to edit and manage the staff section of the website.

## Planned Features

- **Backend Development**: I am in the process of building a backend system that will allow authorized users to edit and update the staff section of the website.

- **User Authentication**: Implementing user authentication to ensure secure access to the backend.

- **Staff Management**: Enabling the addition, modification, and deletion of staff profiles and information.

- **Improved User Experience**: Continuously enhancing the frontend design and user experience.
